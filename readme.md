### Note: Contains two Nodes
Apologies for shoving another node into this repo, I'll eventually create a new repo for the Image From URL 

- Lora Info
- Image From URL

## Image From URL

Loads an image from the URL and makes it available for use in your workflow. This is especially useful if you intend on 
sharing your workflows and want to make it easier for users to use them instead of having to download images separately.
